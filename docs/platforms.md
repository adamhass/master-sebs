SeBS supports three commercial serverless platforms: AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, and Google Cloud Functions.
Furthermore, we support the open source FaaS system OpenWhisk.

The file `config/example.json` contains all parameters that users can change
to customize the deployment.
Some of these parameters, such as cloud credentials or storage instance address,
are required.
In the following subsections, we discuss the mandatory and optional customization
points for each platform.

> [!WARNING]
> On many platforms, credentials can be provided as environment variables or through the SeBS configuration. SeBS will not store your credentials in the cache. When saving results, SeBS stores user benchmark and experiment configuration for documentation and reproducibility, except for credentials that are erased. If you provide the credentials through JSON input configuration, do not commit nor publish these files anywhere.

Supported platforms:
* [Amazon Web Services (AWS) Lambda](#aws-lambda)
* [Microsoft Azure Functions](#azure-functions)
* [Google Cloud (GCP) Functions](#google-cloud-functions)
* [OpenWhisk](#openwhisk)
* [Boki (self-hosted, EC2)](#boki)
* [Cloudburst (self-hosted, EC2)](#cloudburst)

## Storage Configuration

SeBS benchmarks rely on persistent object and NoSQL storage for input and output data. For configuration instructions regarding both object storage and NoSQL databases, please refer to the [storage documentation](storage.md). Storage configuration is particularly important for local deployments, OpenWhisk, and other open-source FaaS platforms.

## Architectures

By default, SeBS defaults functions built for the x64 (x86_64) architecture. On AWS, functions can also be build and deployed for ARM CPUs to benefit from Graviton CPUs available on Lambda.
This change primarily affects functions that make use of dependencies with native builds, such as `torch`, `numpy` or `ffmpeg`.

Such functions can be build as code packages on any platforms, as we rely on package managers like pip and npm to provide binary dependencies.
However, special care is needed to build Docker containers: since installation of packages is a part of the Docker build, we cannot natively execute
binaries based on ARM containers on x86 CPUs. To build multi-platform images, we recommend to follow official [Docker guidelines](https://docs.docker.com/build/building/multi-platform/#build-multi-platform-images) and provide static QEMU installation.
On Ubuntu-based distributions, this requires installing an OS package and executing a single Docker command to provide seamless emulation of ARM containers.

## Cloud Account Identifiers

SeBS ensures that all locally cached cloud resources are valid by storing a unique identifier associated with each cloud account. Furthermore, we store this identifier in experiment results to easily match results with the cloud account or subscription that was used to obtain them. We use non-sensitive identifiers such as account IDs on AWS, subscription IDs on Azure, and Google Cloud project IDs.

If you have JSON result files, such as `experiment.json` from a benchmark run or '<experiment>/*.json' from an experiment, you can remove all identifying information by removing the JSON object `.config.deployment.credentials`. This can be achieved easily with the CLI tool `jq`:

```
jq 'del(.config.deployment.credentials)' <file.json> | sponge <file.json>
```

## AWS Lambda

AWS provides one year of free services, including a significant amount of computing time in AWS Lambda.
To work with AWS, you need to provide access and secret keys to a role with permissions
sufficient to manage functions and S3 resources.
Additionally, the account must have `AmazonAPIGatewayAdministrator` permission to set up
automatically AWS HTTP trigger.
You can provide a [role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-intro-execution-role.html)
with permissions to access AWS Lambda and S3; otherwise, one will be created automatically.
To use a user-defined lambda role, set the name in config JSON - see an example in `config/example.json`.

You can pass the credentials either using the default AWS-specific environment variables:

```
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=XXXX
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=XXXX
```

or in the JSON input configuration:

```json
"deployment": {
  "name": "aws",
  "aws": {
    "region": "us-east-1",
    "lambda-role": "",
    "credentials": {
      "access_key": "YOUR AWS ACCESS KEY",
      "secret_key": "YOUR AWS SECRET KEY"
    }
  }
}
```

## Azure Functions

Azure provides a free tier for 12 months.
You need to create an account and add a [service principal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal)
to enable non-interactive login through CLI.
Since this process has [an easy, one-step CLI solution](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/ad/sp?view=azure-cli-latest#az-ad-sp-create-for-rbac),
we added a small tool **tools/create_azure_credentials** that uses the interactive web-browser
authentication to login into Azure CLI and create a service principal.

```console
Please provide the intended principal name
XXXXX
Please follow the login instructions to generate credentials...
To sign in, use a web browser to open the page https://microsoft.com/devicelogin and enter the code YYYYYYY to authenticate.

Login succesfull with user {'name': 'ZZZZZZ', 'type': 'user'}
Created service principal http://XXXXX

AZURE_SECRET_APPLICATION_ID = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
AZURE_SECRET_TENANT = XXXXXXXXXXXX
AZURE_SECRET_PASSWORD = XXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

**Save these credentials - the password is non-retrievable! Provide them to SeBS and we will create additional resources (storage account, resource group) to deploy functions. We will create a storage account and the resource group and handle access keys.

You can pass the credentials either using the environment variables:

```
export AZURE_SECRET_APPLICATION_ID = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
export AZURE_SECRET_TENANT = XXXXXXXXXXXX
export AZURE_SECRET_PASSWORD = XXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

or in the JSON input configuration:

```json
"deployment": {
  "name": "azure",
  "azure": {
    "region": "westeurope"
    "credentials": {
      "appID": "YOUR SECRET APPLICATION ID",
      "tenant": "YOUR SECRET TENANT",
      "password": "YOUR SECRET PASSWORD"
    }
  }
}
```

> [!WARNING]
> The tool assumes there is only one subscription active on the account. If you want to bind the newly created service principal to a specific subscription, or the created credentials do not work with SeBS and you see errors such as "No subscriptions found for X", then you must specify a subscription when creating the service principal. Check your subscription ID on in the Azure portal, and use the CLI option `tools/create_azure_credentials.py --subscription <SUBSCRIPTION_ID>`.

> [!WARNING]
> When you log in for the first time on a device, Microsoft might require authenticating your login with Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). In this case, we will return an error such as: "The following tenants require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). Use 'az login --tenant TENANT_ID' to explicitly login to a tenant.". Then, you can pass the tenant ID by using the `--tenant <tenant-id>` flag.

### Resources

* By default, all functions are allocated in the single resource group.
* Each function has a separate storage account allocated, following [Azure guidelines](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-best-practices#scalability-best-practices).
* All benchmark data is stored in the same storage account.

## Google Cloud Functions

The Google Cloud Free Tier gives free resources. It has two parts:

- A 12-month free trial with $300 credit to use with any Google Cloud services.
- Always Free, which provides limited access to many common Google Cloud resources, free of charge.

You need to create an account and add [service account](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts) to permit operating on storage and functions. From the cloud problem, download the cloud credentials saved as a JSON file.
You should have at least write access to **Cloud Functions** (`Cloud Functions Admin`) and **Logging** Furthermore, SeBS needs the permissions to create Firestore databases through
Google Cloud CLI tool; the `Firestore Service Agent` role allows for that.

You can pass the credentials either using the default GCP-specific environment variable:

```
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/path/to/project-credentials.json
```

using the SeBS environment variable:

```
export GCP_SECRET_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/path/to/project-credentials.json
```

or in the JSON input configuration:

```json
"deployment": {
  "name": "gcp",
  "gcp": {
    "region": "europe-west1",
    "credentials": "/path/to/project-credentials.json"
  }
}
```

## OpenWhisk

SeBS expects users to deploy and configure an OpenWhisk instance.
Below, you will find example of instruction for deploying OpenWhisk instance.
The configuration parameters of OpenWhisk for SeBS can be found
in `config/example.json` under the key `['deployment']['openwhisk']`.
In the subsections below, we discuss the meaning and use of each parameter.
To correctly deploy SeBS functions to OpenWhisk, following the
subsections on *Toolchain* and *Docker* configuration is particularly important.

For storage configuration in OpenWhisk, refer to the [storage documentation](storage.md), which covers both object storage and NoSQL requirements specific to OpenWhisk deployments.

> [!WARNING]
> Some benchmarks might require larger memory allocations, e.g., 2048 MB. Not all OpenWhisk deployments support this out-of-the-box.
> The deployment section below shows an example of changing the default function memory limit from 512 MB to a higher value.

### Deployment

In `tools/openwhisk_preparation.py`, we include scripts that help install
[kind (Kubernetes in Docker)](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) and deploy
OpenWhisk on a `kind` cluster. Alternatively, you can deploy to an existing
cluster by [using offical deployment instructions](https://github.com/apache/openwhisk-deploy-kube/blob/master/docs/k8s-kind.md):

```shell
./deploy/kind/start-kind.sh
helm install owdev ./helm/openwhisk -n openwhisk --create-namespace -f deploy/kind/mycluster.yaml
kubectl get pods -n openwhisk --watch
```

To change the maximum memory allocation per function, edit the `max` value under `memory` in file `helm/openwhisk/values.yaml`.
To run all benchmarks, we recommend of at least "2048m".

### Toolchain

We use OpenWhisk's CLI tool [wsk](https://github.com/apache/openwhisk-cli)
to manage the deployment of functions to OpenWhisk.
Please install `wsk`and configure it to point to your OpenWhisk installation.
By default, SeBS assumes that `wsk` is available in the `PATH`.
To override this, set the configuration option `wskExec` to the location
of your `wsk` executable.
If you are using a local deployment of OpenWhisk with a self-signed
certificate, you can skip certificate validation with the `wsk` flag `--insecure`.
To enable this option, set `wskBypassSecurity` to `true`.
At the moment, all functions are deployed as [*web actions*](https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/blob/master/docs/webactions.md)
that do not require credentials to invoke functions.

Furthermore, SeBS can be configured to remove the `kind`
cluster after finishing experiments automatically.
The boolean option `removeCluster` helps to automate the experiments
that should be conducted on fresh instances of the system.

### Docker

In FaaS platforms, the function's code can usually be deployed as a code package
or a Docker image with all dependencies preinstalled.
However, OpenWhisk has a very low code package size limit of only 48 megabytes.
So, to circumvent this limit, we deploy functions using pre-built Docker images.

**Important**: OpenWhisk requires that all Docker images are available
in the registry, even if they have been cached on a system serving OpenWhisk
functions.
Function invocations will fail when the image is not available after a
timeout with an error message that does not directly indicate image availability issues.
Therefore, all SeBS benchmark functions are available on the Docker Hub.

When adding new functions and extending existing functions with new languages
and new language versions, Docker images must be placed in the registry.
However, pushing the image to the default `spcleth/serverless-benchmarks`
repository on Docker Hub requires permissions.
To use a different Docker Hub repository, change the key
`['general']['docker_repository']` in `config/systems.json`.


Alternatively, OpenWhisk users can configure the FaaS platform to use a custom and
private Docker registry and push new images there.
A local Docker registry can speed up development when debugging a new function.
SeBS can use alternative Docker registry - see `dockerRegistry` settings
in the example to configure registry endpoint and credentials.
When the `registry` URL is not provided, SeBS will use Docker Hub.
When `username` and `password` are provided, SeBS will log in to the repository
and push new images before invoking functions.
See the documentation on the
[Docker registry](https://github.com/apache/openwhisk-deploy-kube/blob/master/docs/private-docker-registry.md)
and [OpenWhisk configuration](https://github.com/apache/openwhisk-deploy-kube/blob/master/docs/private-docker-registry.md)
for details.

**Warning**: this feature is experimental and has not been tested extensively.
At the moment, it cannot be used on a `kind` cluster due to issues with
Docker authorization on invoker nodes. [See the OpenWhisk issue for details](https://github.com/apache/openwhisk-deploy-kube/issues/721).

### Code Deployment

SeBS builds and deploys a new code package when constructing the local cache,
when the function's contents have changed, and when the user requests a forced rebuild.
In OpenWhisk, this setup is changed - SeBS will first attempt to verify 
if the image exists already in the registry and skip building the Docker
image when possible.
Then, SeBS can deploy seamlessly to OpenWhisk using default images
available on Docker Hub.
Furthermore, checking for image existence in the registry helps
avoid failing invocations in OpenWhisk.
For performance reasons, this check is performed only once when 
initializing the local cache for the first time.

When the function code is updated,
SeBS will build the image and push it to the registry.
Currently, the only available option of checking image existence in
the registry is pulling the image.
However, Docker's [experimental `manifest` feature](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/manifest/)
allows checking image status without downloading its contents, saving bandwidth and time.
To use that feature in SeBS, set the `experimentalManifest` flag to true.

### Storage

OpenWhisk has a `shutdownStorage` switch that controls the behavior of SeBS.
When set to true, SeBS will remove the Minio instance after finishing all work.

## Boki

Boki is a self-hosted stateful serverless runtime based on a shared log abstraction ([SOSP '21](https://github.com/ut-osa/boki)). Deployed as a multi-node EC2 cluster via Terraform (`integrations/boki/aws/EC2/`).

### Infrastructure

**Multi-node EC2 deployment** with separate infrastructure and engine nodes. All Boki components run as Docker containers using the official `zjia/boki:sosp-ae` image with `--privileged` for `io_uring` access.

| Node | Role | Components |
|------|------|------------|
| Infrastructure (`infra`) | Fixed cluster services | ZooKeeper, Controller, 2x Sequencer, Storage, Gateway (port 8080) |
| Engine(s) (ASG) | Scalable compute | Engine + Launcher + Worker(s) per node |

Engine nodes register with ZooKeeper on the infra node and are discovered by the Gateway for load-balanced function dispatch. Workers communicate with the Engine via IPC (shared tmpfs), so each Engine node is a self-contained compute unit. Scaling = more Engine EC2 instances.

### Benchmark

The Boki benchmark is a **Go binary** (not Python) because the shared log API (`BokiStore`, `BokiQueue` in `slib/lib.go`) is Go-only. The Python stub in `benchmarks/900.stateful/boki-shared-log/python/function.py` is dead code. The Go binary runs inside the Engine container and returns JSON responses matching the SeBS `ExecutionResult` format.

### Deployment

```bash
cd integrations/boki/aws/EC2/
# Set key_pair_name and admin_cidr in terraform.tfvars
terraform init && terraform plan && terraform apply
# Wait ~60s for ZK setup + engine registration, then test
curl http://<INFRA_IP>:8080/function/statefulBench?state_key=test&state_size_kb=1&ops=1
```

### SeBS Provider Integration (2026-04-02)

Boki is registered as a SeBS provider in `sebs/boki/`. Since Boki functions are pre-deployed Go binaries, the provider **completely bypasses** SeBS's code packaging and Docker build pipeline:

- `get_function()` — overridden to skip `code_package.build()`. Returns a `BokiFunction` pointing at the gateway URL.
- `create_trigger()` — returns an `HTTPTrigger` that POSTs to `{gateway_url}/function/{function_name}`.
- All lifecycle methods (`package_code`, `create_function`, `update_function`) are no-ops.
- Activated with `SEBS_WITH_BOKI=true` environment variable.

**Config** (`config/boki-experiment.json`):
```json
{
  "deployment": {
    "name": "boki",
    "boki": {
      "gateway_url": "http://16.170.141.184:8080",
      "function_name": "statefulBench"
    }
  }
}
```

**Run:**
```bash
SEBS_WITH_BOKI=true python3 sebs.py experiment invoke perf-cost --config config/boki-experiment.json
```

## Cloudburst

Cloudburst is a self-hosted stateful serverless runtime with co-located caching via [Anna KVS](https://github.com/hydro-project/anna) (VLDB '20). Upstream repo: [hydro-project/cloudburst](https://github.com/hydro-project/cloudburst). Deployed on EC2 via Terraform (`integrations/cloudburst/aws/`).

For architecture diagrams, see:
- [diagrams/cloudburst\_architecture.puml](diagrams/cloudburst_architecture.puml) — deployment topology
- [diagrams/cloudburst\_benchmark\_flow.puml](diagrams/cloudburst_benchmark_flow.puml) — per-invocation sequence
- [diagrams/three\_system\_comparison.puml](diagrams/three_system_comparison.puml) — comparison with Lambda+Redis and Boki

### Infrastructure

Deployed as 5+ EC2 instances + Anna KVS Docker containers:

| Node | Instance | Role |
|------|----------|------|
| Scheduler | `t3.medium` | Dispatches function calls to executors via ZMQ |
| Executor x2-4 | `t3.medium` (ASG, auto-start) | Runs benchmark functions, accesses Anna KVS |
| Anna KVS | `t3.medium` | State storage — 3 Docker containers (route, kvs, monitor) |
| Client + HTTP gateway | `t3.small` | HTTP→ZMQ bridge (port 8088) for external invocation |

All in a dedicated VPC (`10.30.0.0/16`). Cluster-internal traffic via ZMQ (ports 5000-5011) and Anna KVS (port 6450). Executor ASG scales with `enable_auto_start = true` — new instances auto-bootstrap and connect to the scheduler.

### Anna KVS

Anna KVS is a C++ lattice-based distributed KVS. It is **not** bundled with Cloudburst and must be deployed separately. We run it as Docker containers built from `base_systems/anna/dockerfiles/anna.dockerfile` (base image: `hydroproject/base:latest`).

Single-node deployment uses `local=True` mode which bypasses Anna's routing tier and communicates directly with the KVS process on port 6450. This is sufficient for benchmarking but does not exercise Anna's replication or multi-node features.

```bash
# Build Anna Docker image on the Anna EC2 node
cd /tmp && git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/hydro-project/anna
cd anna/dockerfiles && docker build -f anna.dockerfile -t anna:local .

# Run Anna processes
docker run -d --name anna-route   --network host -v /tmp/anna-conf/anna-config.yml:/hydro/anna/conf/anna-config.yml anna:local bash -c "cd /hydro/anna && ./build/target/kvs/anna-route"
docker run -d --name anna-kvs     --network host -v /tmp/anna-conf/anna-config.yml:/hydro/anna/conf/anna-config.yml anna:local bash -c "cd /hydro/anna && ./build/target/kvs/anna-kvs"
docker run -d --name anna-monitor --network host -v /tmp/anna-conf/anna-config.yml:/hydro/anna/conf/anna-config.yml anna:local bash -c "cd /hydro/anna && ./build/target/kvs/anna-monitor"
```

### Benchmark

The benchmark function follows Cloudburst's native executor convention:

```python
def stateful_benchmark(cloudburst, state_key, state_size_kb, ops, request_id):
    cloudburst.put(state_key, blob)   # Anna KVS write
    cloudburst.get(state_key)          # Anna KVS read
    # ... lightweight compute ...
    return {"request_id": ..., "is_cold": False, "begin": ..., "end": ..., "measurement": {...}}
```

A benchmark runner module (`master-cloudburst/cloudburst/server/benchmarks/stateful.py`) registers the function and runs it via `CloudburstConnection`. Invoke:

```bash
CLOUDBURST_LOCAL=true STATE_SIZE_KB=64 python3 cloudburst/client/run_benchmark.py stateful <scheduler_ip> <num_requests> <client_ip>
```

### Deployment

```bash
cd integrations/cloudburst/aws/
# Set key_pair_name and admin_cidr in terraform.tfvars
terraform init && terraform plan && terraform apply
# Then deploy Anna KVS Docker containers on the Anna node (see above)
# Start scheduler, executors manually or set enable_auto_start = true
```

### HTTP Gateway (2026-04-02)

Cloudburst is invoked via an HTTP→ZMQ bridge (`scripts/cloudburst_http_gateway.py`) running on the client EC2 node. This enables uniform HTTP invocation from the benchmarking machine, matching the Boki and Lambda invocation paths.

```bash
# On the client EC2 node:
export PYTHONPATH=/opt/cloudburst/cloudburst
python3 cloudburst_http_gateway.py --scheduler-ip 10.30.1.117 --port 8088

# From the benchmarking machine:
curl -X POST http://13.60.72.131:8088/function/stateful_bench \
  -d '{"request_id":"test"}'
```

The gateway lazily creates a `CloudburstConnection`, registers the benchmark function + DAG on first request, then translates subsequent HTTP POST requests to `call_dag()` over ZMQ. See `LIMITATIONS.md` L1 for the extra-hop latency caveat.

### SeBS Provider Integration (2026-04-02)

A SeBS provider also exists in `sebs/cloudburst_provider/` for VPC-internal execution (ZMQ-based `LibraryTrigger`). However, for the experiment matrix, the HTTP gateway + `batch_invoke.py` approach is preferred since it runs from the same machine as all other experiments.

**Scaling (2026-04-02):** Executor ASG validated — scaled 2→3, new executor auto-bootstrapped (cloned repo, built protobuf, installed deps), auto-started, and connected to scheduler without manual intervention. Scale command:
```bash
aws autoscaling set-desired-capacity --auto-scaling-group-name master-sebs-cloudburst-executors --desired-capacity 3
```
